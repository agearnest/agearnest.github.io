### Machine Learning Capstone Project: Detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions

For my Machine Learning Capstone Project, I chose to work on the task of credit card fraud detection. Specifically, I trained models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data from the given dataset via Kaggle. The reason I chose this particular task and dataset is because it is crucial for credit card companies to be able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This is important not only for the financial security of the companies but also for the protection of customers from unauthorized charges. It is particularly important in today's society, where rising inflation makes it harder for people to make ends meet, and they rely heavily on their credit cards to cover their expenses.

As we all know, financial security is a top priority for people, and fraudulent activities can create a disarray in their financial lives. In recent years, the use of credit cards has become more common due to the convenience they offer over traditional payment methods. One of the primary reasons why people choose to use credit cards is the ease with which they can dispute fraudulent or unauthorized transactions. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, credit card companies can quickly identify fraudulent transactions, prevent fraudsters from causing financial damage, and improve their overall financial stability.

In summary, my Machine Learning Capstone Project focuses on the task of fraud detection, specifically for credit card transactions. Through the use of machine learning techniques, I was able to train a model to detect fraudulent transactions effectively. This project is of great significance to credit card companies and their customers as it improves their financial security and helps in preventing fraudulent activities.
