### Results and Analysis

In logistic regression, the output of the model is transformed using a logistic function. This function maps the output values to a range between 0 and 1. This transformation is necessary because logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to the positive class, which is typically encoded as 1. For the dataset used in this project, the positive class was the fraudulent transactions denoted with 1. The output of the logistic regression model can be interpreted as the probability of the input belonging to the positive class. The logistic function ensures that the output is bounded between 0 and 1, which is necessary for interpreting the output as a probability.

In addition to the logistic regression classifier, the performance of the model was evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insight into the model's performance on the test set. After accounting for undersampling and using a 20% test set, the logistic regression model achieved excellent scores above 90% for all the performance metrics utilized. These scores indicate that the linear regression model was successful in accurately predicting both genuine and fraudulent transactions. The combination of undersampling and a 20% test set helped to limit the impact of class imbalance and overfitting and allowed the model to perform well on the test set. I ran the program several times, and this was one iteration of results:

Along with the logistic regression classifier, the SVM classifier yielded excellent, accurate results. SVM's goal is to find a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between the classes. SVM decision boundaries with large margins tend to have lower generalization error which means they generalize better to unseen data. In conclusion, each of the four classifiers were able to determine fraudulent credit card transactions well, however the SVM classifer and logistic regression were consistent and efficient.
