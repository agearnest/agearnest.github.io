### The Problem and Dataset

For my capstone project, I have chosen to train a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the fraudulent occurences account for roughly 0.2% of all transactions.
