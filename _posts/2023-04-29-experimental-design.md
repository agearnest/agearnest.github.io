### Experimental Design

To begin with, I obtained the dataset from Kaggle and conducted a thorough analysis of the provided information. Afterwards, I checked for missing values and discovered zero, hence no need to alter the dataset in that sense. I then assigned the dataset to different variables, with a value of 0 for genuine transactions and 1 for fraudulent transactions. I also noted the severe imbalance in the dataset and performed undersampling to ensure a more even distribution, resulting in 492 cases for each class. With undersampling, I eliminated the bias of the majority class, in this case genuine transactions, and created a 50/50 split in the data which will yield better results.

Following the undersampling, I split and scaled the data, using a 20% test set. Although I experimented with a 30% test set, a 20% test set provided more accurate results. I also tested two different scaling methods, StandardScalar and MinMaxScalar, but did not observe a significant difference in my results. Therefore, I did not include the scaled values in the logistic regression classifier.

Furthermore, I selected logistic regression as the model for this problem since it is suitable for predicting binary outcomes. As the problem at hand was to detect fraud, i.e., genuine or fraudulent, I needed to predict a binary outcome. The algorithm is based on a linear regression model, which models the relationship between input features and output values using a linear equation. Logistic Regression is a linear model that is suitable for linearly separable classes, which means the decision boundary is a straight line, and it is typically used for binary classification. In our particular dataset, we have a binary outcome: genuine or fraudulent. 

In logistic regression, the output is transformed using a logistic function, which maps the output values to a range between 0 and 1. This transformation makes the output interpretable as probabilities of belonging to the positive class. In addition to the logistic regression classifier, I evaluated the performance of the logistic classifier on the testing set using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. After accounting for undersampling and a 20% test size, each performance metric utilized resulted in excellent scores above 90%.

In conclusion, based on my analysis of the dataset, including importing data, evaluating missing values, performing undersampling, and splitting and scaling the data, I determined that logistic regression with undersampling and 20% test set produced the most accurate results and was therefore the best model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
