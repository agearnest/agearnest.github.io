I'm Abby Earnest, and I'm studying Mathematical Sciences. I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from FSU, and I am now pursuing my Master's degree at the University of West Florida.

This blog was designed to accompany my Capstone Project for Machine Learning where I trained a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction data.
